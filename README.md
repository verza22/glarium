# Glarium

Glarium is a project that originally started as a clone of the MMORTS **Ikariam**. I worked on it for a couple of months, building the database, backend, and starting the frontend.

---

### Technology Stack

**Backend:** Node.js, Express + TypeScript  
**Frontend:** React 19 + TypeScript  
**Database:** MySQL  
**Deployment:** Everything runs in Docker

### Installation

To start the project, simply run:  

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

This will automatically build and start all containers: backend, frontend, and MySQL. Once the process finishes, the app will be ready to use.
